# eruma-react-wp
Wordpress theme built with React and WP REST API.
This project was beginning it's life as student project at the Front-end course (Nackademin) in 2017.
It was used to show my newfound knowledge about React Redux, while keep exploring new exiting developments within my favoured CMS Wordpress.
The goal I set out was to be able to develop a function WP blog but with a React Redux front-end rather than WP templating.

Further development of the project happened post June 2017 when I graduated.

Edit: 2018-07-12: Name changed. Project still on hold. Eruma-Go to become name of new WP2018 theme for eruma.se.
